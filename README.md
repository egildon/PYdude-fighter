# PYdude-fighter
Python fighting game first attempt


First commit. This game is broken because I tried to transition from python 2 to python 3 and the converter broke my methods. I have currently switched to C++ for speed optimizations and longevity.

Because of my love for Python I have decided to revive this project and attempt to pickup where I diverged with a commitment to Python and GOODOT
